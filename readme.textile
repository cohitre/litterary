h1. litterary

A simple rails app for posting and commenting on simple text documents.

h2. About

I created a first version of this in 2007 to teach myself Javascript. I returned to the code in 2010 and was embarrased to see how ugly it was. 

A production instance of this application is hosted on "http://litterary.com":http://litterary.com and the code can be downloaded from "github":http://github.com/cohitre/litterary.


It is open source and released under the terms of the "GNU General Public License v2 (GPL)":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html.

h2. Setting it up

There's a site.yml.example file. Rename it to site.yml and update the attributes as needed.
